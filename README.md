# send-html-emails-with-python
### This script will help you create html templates for emails and send them via python.

### The html template created in this code is a demo template I created for an organization. You can edit it and create any kind of template with your own HTMl and CSS and add it as string replacing the _html_ variabale in this code and embed images or attach files in the same mail.
